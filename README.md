# Character-Creator
This project is a CRUD app using C Sharp and Razor Pages. I chose to use Razor Pages as I wanted to continue with my C sharp learning and make a quick front end without having to switch to javascript or spend much time on the html/css front end. The focus of this project was to learn CRUD operations, write tests and use Dapper to write SQL queries as I wanted to write raw SQL commands. The UI is a simple bootstrap table with bootstrap buttons.
