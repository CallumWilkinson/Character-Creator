# Character-Creator
This is my second project - a simple CRUD app using C Sharp and Razor Pages. I chose to use Razor Pages as I wanted to continue with my C sharp journey and make a quick front end without having to switch to javascript or spend much time on the css. The focus of this project was to learn CRUD operations, write tests and use Dapper to write SQL queries as I wanted to write raw SQL commands. The UI is a simple bootstrap table with bootstrap buttons.

Alot of the intial learning from this project was setting up the SQL lite database connection and writing tests so that I could create a "fresh" in-memory database with each test. This allowed me leave the actual database alone untill I could prove that each function worked without breaking my previous tests. I then spent some time learning about the MVC model and how HTTP requests work. After that I wrote more tests as I continued to build out each of the CRUD operations.
